# Linktree
A personalized linktree page created by me that includes all the links to my social media, threads, code, or other forums.

Social Media Site including links to my projects and ways to get in contact with me.

# Tech used: ![ReactBadge](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB)
My learning was focused on making a simple UI that resembled a linktree with a smooth UX added with a music theme for the page.

# Optimizations

To improve this website, I plan on

Faster rendering on the images of the page for the mobile design. It might be complicated because of how it is set up but will be something I will look into.
Clean up the design on the lenses with the grid layout.
Implement a round image for my main image of me for the mobile design. Right now there is an oval.

# Lessons Learned:

<ul>
  <li>Styling issue with centering the text. The solution was to add a <div> tag around the <SocialIcon> tags in order to make the text center and position that <div> to be absolute. </li>
</ul>

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
